Random algorithms &amp; data structures snippets

This is just a collection of random problems I've been doing.

This isn't organized yet, and it's just a giant dump of what was on my computer.

I'll be organizing it and adding more problems.

| Problem        | Type           | File  |
| -------------- |:---------------:| -----:|
| [Find length of the largest region in Boolean Matrix](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-length-largest-region-boolean-matrix/) | matrix | [matrix.largest-region.js](./matrix.largest-region.js) |
| [Reverse a linked list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-linked-list/) | linked list | [linkedList.reverse-iterative.js](./linkedList.reverse-iterative.js) |
| [A program to check if a binary tree is BST or not](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-program-to-check-if-a-binary-tree-is-bst-or-not/) | binary search tree | [bst.check-bst.js](./bst.check-bst.js) |
